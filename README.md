# Round-Robin-with-Load-Balancing-Case-Assignment-in-Salesforce-using-Triggerss

The task involves implementing round-robin/load-balancing case assignment functionality in Salesforce using triggers. This involves creating a custom object named "Case Routing" to store configuration records for round-robin assignment, defining fields for category, user, and activation status. Additionally, a trigger on the "Case" object is developed to automate case assignment based on defined routing configurations. The trigger assigns new case records to users in a rotating manner, ensuring fair distribution of workload among team members. Rotation resets when all users have been assigned a record. Thorough testing and documentation are required for accurate and maintainable implementation.
